---

## Introduction (2 minutes)

**Script:**
"Hi [Name], thanks so much for joining this exit interview and for participating in our pilot program. This call should take about appropriate time. I'd like to record this conversation so I can focus on our discussion rather than taking notes—is that okay with you?"

[Wait for permission]

"Great, thank you. I've reviewed your survey responses, and I have a few follow-up questions to dive deeper into your experience. There are no right or wrong answers—I'm just here to learn from your honest feedback."

---

## Section 1: Overall Impression (5 minutes)

1. **"Let's start big picture: What was your overall impression of Financial RISE?"**

   [Listen, probe for specific examples]

2. **"What did you like most about the product?"**

   [Note specific features they mention]

3. **"What frustrated you most or what would you change first if you could?"**

   [Probe: Why was that frustrating? How often did it happen?]

4. **"On your survey, you rated us [X/10] for overall satisfaction. Can you tell me more about that rating?"**

   [If low: "What would it take to get to a 9 or 10?"]
   [If high: "What specifically earned that high rating?"]

---

## Section 2: Feature-Specific Deep Dive (appropriate time)

7. **"Was the questionnaire length appropriate? About how long did it take your clients?"**

8. **"The consultant report included communication strategies based on your client's personality profile (DISC). Did you find those strategies helpful?"**

   [Probe: Did you actually use them? Were they accurate?]

9. **"The DISC profiling is intentionally hidden from clients—they don't see their 'D', 'I', 'S', 'C' scores. Do you think that was the right approach?"**

   [Alternative: Should clients see their DISC profile?]

### Phase Results (3 minutes)

10. **"The results page showed your client's primary financial phase (Stabilize, Organize, Build, Grow, or Systemic). Did that assessment align with your own understanding of where your client is at?"**

    [Dealbreaker check]

---

## Section 4: Pricing & Business Model (3 minutes)

20. **"On your survey, you indicated you'd be willing to pay [$X-$Y] per period. Can you walk me through that pricing decision—what were you comparing to?"**

21. **"At what price point would Financial RISE be a 'no-brainer' purchase for you—where you'd subscribe immediately without hesitation?"**

22. **"Would you prefer a subscription subscription (unlimited assessments) or pay-per-assessment model?"**
