### Your Personalized Assessment Results

Thank you for completing your Financial RISE assessment! This report provides insights into your business's current financial readiness and outlines specific actions to help you move forward.

### What Your Phase Means

Your assessment has identified your primary financial phase. Here's what each phase means:

**Phase 1: Stabilize - Building Your Foundation**

You're focused on getting the basics right:
- Establishing reliable bookkeeping
- Ensuring compliance (taxes, payroll)
- Managing debt effectively
- Cleaning up historical financials

**What this means:** You're in the foundation-building stage. This is where every successful business starts - getting your financial house in order before moving to more advanced planning.

**Typical timeline:** 3-6 months of focused work

---

**Phase 2: Organize - Creating Systems**

You're setting up foundational systems:
- Proper Chart of Accounts structure
- System integration (accounting, CRM, inventory)
- Organized financial workflows
- Standardized processes

**What this means:** Your basics are solid, and now you're creating the systems that will support your growth. This phase is about building infrastructure.

**Typical timeline:** 3-6 months

---

**Phase 3: Build - Developing Robust Processes**

You're creating advanced operational systems:
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Team financial literacy training
- Custom financial tools and dashboards
- Automated reporting

**What this means:** You have strong systems and are now creating processes that allow your business to run smoothly without constant oversight.

**Typical timeline:** 6-12 months

---

**Phase 4: Grow - Strategic Planning**

You're focused on forward-looking financial strategy:
- Cash flow projections (12+ months)
- Revenue forecasting
- Scenario planning
- Growth modeling

**What this means:** Your financial operations are solid, and you're now using financial data strategically to plan for growth and make informed business decisions.

**Typical timeline:** 6-12 months

---

**Systemic: Financial Literacy (Cross-Cutting)**

This isn't a sequential phase but a foundational skill:
- Reading and interpreting financial reports
- Understanding key metrics
- Making data-driven decisions
- Financial confidence

**What this means:** Financial literacy supports all other phases. As you progress through the phases, your financial literacy grows alongside.

**Timeline:** Ongoing development

---

### Understanding Multi-Phase Results

Some businesses are in transition between phases. If your report shows multiple phases:

**Example:** 60% Organize, 40% Build

This means:
- You've largely completed the Organize phase (60%)
- You're beginning the Build phase (40%)
- Your action plan will address both phases
- Focus first on completing Organize phase items
- Then transition to Build phase priorities

### Your Action Plan

Your report includes 3-5 prioritized action items specifically chosen for your business. These are:

✅ **Specific** - Clear, concrete actions
✅ **Relevant** - Based on your actual responses
✅ **Achievable** - Realistic for your resources
✅ **Impactful** - Directly improve your financial operations

### How to Use This Report

**1. Review with Your Consultant**

Your consultant will walk you through:
- What your phase means for your business

- How to prioritize implementation
- Expected timeline and outcomes

**2. Create an Implementation Plan**

Work with your consultant to:
- Break actions into manageable steps
- Set realistic timelines
- Assign responsibilities
- Schedule check-ins

**3. Track Progress**

As you implement recommendations:
- Document what you've completed
- Note challenges and solutions

- Adjust as needed

**4. Reassess Periodically**

After significant progress (typically 90-180 days):
- Retake the assessment
- Measure your advancement
- Identify next priorities
- Continue your journey

### Common Questions

**Q: Is it bad that I'm in an early phase?**

A: Not at all! Every business starts at Stabilize. What matters is that you're committed to improvement. Knowing where you are lets you create the right plan.

**Q: How long until I reach the next phase?**

A: It varies by business, but typically 3-6 months of focused work per phase. Your consultant will provide a realistic timeline based on your specific situation.

**Q: What if I disagree with my results?**

A: Discuss with your consultant. Sometimes results surprise us, but they're based on your responses. Your consultant can help you understand the assessment and may identify areas for clarification.

## 6. Client FAQ

**General Questions:**

**Q: How is this different from a financial audit?**

A: Financial RISE is not an audit. We're not reviewing your financial statements for accuracy. Instead, we're assessing your financial processes, systems, and practices to identify opportunities for improvement.

**Q: Do I need to share my financial statements?**

A: No. The assessment asks about your practices and processes, not specific numbers from your financials. You're welcome to share financials with your consultant if you choose, but it's not required for the assessment.

**Q: Will this tell me if my business is healthy?**

A: The assessment evaluates your financial readiness - meaning how well-equipped you are to make financial decisions, plan for growth, and manage your business's financial operations. It's different from evaluating profitability, but both are important.

**Q: What if I don't know the answer to a question?**

A: Answer as best you can based on your understanding. If you're truly unsure, select the option that seems closest to your situation. Your consultant can clarify during your results discussion.

**Technical Questions:**

**Q: What if I get interrupted while taking the assessment?**

A: No problem! Your progress is saved automatically every 60 seconds. You can close your browser and return later using the same link to pick up where you left off.

**Q: Can I change my answers after submitting?**

A: Once submitted, responses cannot be changed. However, if you realize you made a significant error, contact your consultant who can help determine if a retake is warranted.

**Q: How long is my assessment link valid?**

A: Assessment links typically expire 7 days after being sent. If your link expires, contact your consultant for a new one.

**Q: Is the assessment mobile-friendly?**

A: Yes, but we recommend using a desktop or laptop for the best experience. Tablets are acceptable. Phones work but may be harder to read and navigate.

**Results Questions:**

**Q: How accurate are the results?**

A: The assessment has been validated with 95% DISC accuracy and 93% phase accuracy across diverse business scenarios. Results are based on your responses and reflect your self-reported practices.

**Q: What if I don't agree with my results?**

A: Discuss with your consultant. Results are generated from your responses, but your consultant can help interpret them and may identify areas where clarification would be helpful.

**Q: Can I retake the assessment?**

A: Yes, though we recommend waiting at least 90 days after implementing recommendations. This gives you time to make meaningful changes that will be reflected in a retake.

**Privacy Questions:**

**Q: Who sees my assessment responses?**

A: Only you and your consultant. Responses are stored securely and never shared with third parties. Aggregate anonymized data may be used for improving the assessment.

**Q: How is my data protected?**

A: We use industry-standard encryption (TLS 1.2+), secure cloud storage, and comply with GDPR and CCPA privacy regulations. See our Privacy Policy for full details.

**Q: Can I request deletion of my data?**
