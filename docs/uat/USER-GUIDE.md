**Option B: Virtual Collaborative Session (Recommended)**
1. Schedule Zoom/Teams call with client
2. Share your screen showing the assessment
3. Read questions aloud to client
4. Discuss responses together
5. Enter client's responses as you go
6. Client sees the interface but you control the navigation

**Option C: Solo Assessment (Consultant Only)**

2. Answer questions from consultant perspective
3. No client involvement in this session

- Bullet points and short paragraphs
- ROI and results emphasis
- "You can achieve X by doing Y"
- Focus on efficiency and bottom line

**I (Influence) Clients:**
- Enthusiastic, collaborative tone
- Big-picture opportunities
- Social proof and success stories
- "Together we'll accomplish..."
- Colorful visuals and engaging layout

**S (Steadiness) Clients:**
- Gentle, reassuring language
- Step-by-step guidance
- Emphasis on stability and support
- "We'll take this one step at a time..."
- Calming, supportive tone

**C (Compliance) Clients:**
- Detailed, thorough explanations
- Data and analysis
- Logical structure
- "Based on your responses, the analysis shows..."
- Accuracy and precision emphasis

**Note:** Client NEVER sees "DISC" label or scores. Adaptation is invisible - they just receive a report that "speaks their language."

## Best Practices

### Before the Assessment Session

**1. Prepare Your Client**
- Send calendar invite with 60-90 minute time block
- Explain what to expect: "We'll review your business's financial readiness together"
- Set expectations: "This is collaborative - I'll ask questions and we'll discuss together"
- Technical setup: "We'll screen share, so no software needed on your end"

**2. Set Up Your Environment**
- Quiet, professional space
- Reliable internet connection
- Headset or good microphone for virtual sessions
- Second monitor (optional but helpful for notes)
- Close other browser tabs to avoid distractions

**3. Review the Questions**
- Familiarize yourself with question flow
- Practice with a test assessment first
- Know which questions might need explanation

### During the Assessment Session

**1. Build Rapport**
- Start with friendly conversation
- Explain the purpose: "This assessment helps me understand where your business is and create a personalized roadmap"
- Reassure: "There are no right or wrong answers - just honest reflection of where you are today"

**2. Guide, Don't Interrogate**
- Read questions naturally, in your own words
- Pause for client to think
- Encourage discussion: "Tell me more about that..."
- Use your expertise: "In my experience, businesses at your stage often..."

**3. Handle Sensitive Questions**
- Normalize challenges: "Many business owners struggle with this"
- Emphasize confidentiality: "This is just between us"
- Allow "Not Applicable" when appropriate
- Skip and come back if client is uncomfortable (use Previous button)

**4. Keep Energy Up**
- Take short breaks if needed (auto-save protects progress)
- Encourage client: "We're making great progress - halfway there!"
- Stay engaged and curious

**5. DISC Questions (Hidden from Client)**
- These questions are interspersed throughout
- Read them naturally like any other question
- Client shouldn't notice they're different
- Don't mention "personality assessment" or "DISC"

### After the Assessment

**1. Generate Reports Immediately**
- While client is still on call (if virtual)
- "Give me 5 seconds to generate your personalized report..."
- Preview consultant report briefly

**2. Review Client Report Together (Optional)**
- Share screen showing client report
- Walk through key findings
- Highlight quick wins
- Build excitement about roadmap
- "I'll email this to you after our call"

**3. Schedule Follow-Up**
- Don't leave client hanging: "Let's schedule a follow-up in 2 weeks to review progress"
- Mention next steps from report
- Set clear expectations

**4. Send Reports**
- Email client their report PDF (client version only)
- Keep consultant report for your records
- Include brief email: "Here's your personalized Financial Readiness Report. Looking forward to our follow-up on [date]"

### Tips for Accurate DISC Profiling

DISC questions assess client's behavioral style. To get accurate results:

**Do:**
- Observe client's actual behavior during session
- Ask questions naturally and read responses carefully
- Use your professional judgment - you know this client
- Trust the algorithm - it's statistically validated

**Don't:**
- Tell client you're assessing their personality (keep it subtle)
- Rush through DISC questions
- Second-guess your client's responses
- Over-explain DISC questions (read them naturally)

### Tips for Accurate Phase Determination

Phase determination assesses financial readiness across 5 phases. For accuracy:

**Do:**
- Encourage honest responses, not aspirational ones
- Ask "Where are you TODAY?" not "Where do you want to be?"
- Use "Not Applicable" appropriately (e.g., inventory questions for service businesses)
- Discuss gray areas: "Tell me more about your current invoicing process..."

**Don't:**
- Let client inflate responses to "look good"
- Skip questions that seem tedious (they all matter)
- Rush through financial questions (these are scored for phases)

## FAQs

**Q: How long does an assessment take?**
A: 45-90 minutes for a collaborative session with your client. First assessment may take longer as you familiarize yourself with the tool.

**Q: Can I save and resume later?**
A: Yes! Auto-save tracks your progress continuously. You can safely close the browser and resume anytime.

**Q: Can my client fill out the assessment alone?**
A: The tool is designed for **consultant-led collaborative sessions**. While technically a client could fill it out alone, we recommend you guide them through it for best results and to leverage your expertise.

**Q: How accurate is the DISC profiling?**
A: The DISC algorithm uses 12+ questions and is statistically validated. With honest responses, accuracy is typically 80-90%. Trust your professional judgment - if results seem off, note it in feedback.

**Q: What if my client falls into multiple phases?**
A: That's normal! The algorithm can identify secondary phases for clients in transition. The primary phase is their main focus, while secondary phases show areas they're beginning to address.

**Q: Can I edit responses after completing the assessment?**
A: Yes, you can navigate back through the questionnaire and change answers even after completion. Regenerate reports to reflect changes.

**Q: Can I customize the reports?**
A: Not in the MVP version. Report templates are standardized to ensure consistency. Customization (branding, content) is planned for Phase 2.

**Q: How do I share the client report?**
A: Download the client report PDF and email it to your client. Email delivery from within the system is coming in Phase 2.

**Q: What happens to client data?**
A: All data is securely stored with encryption. Only you (the consultant who created the assessment) can access it. We comply with GDPR, CCPA, and all applicable privacy laws.

**Q: Who do I contact for technical support?**
A: During UAT, use Slack #uat-bugs for bugs or support@financialrise.com for other issues.
