## ⚠️ Issues & Concerns

### Monitoring Status
- **24-hour monitoring started:** 18:13 (Hour 1 of 24)
- **Current hour:** Hour 4
- **Active processes:** No monitoring processes detected
- **Last successful update:** 20:26 (Hour 3)
- **Current update file:** Empty (20:27, 21:27)

⚠️ **CONCERN:** Monitoring script appears to have stopped generating updates. The monitoring-24h.pid file shows PID 48515, but process may not be running.

### From Latest Review (17:40)
The autonomous reviewer identified these issues requiring attention:

**🟠 HIGH Priority:**
- HIGH-001: Puppeteer security vulnerabilities (tar-fs CVE)
- HIGH-002: Zod version mismatch (backend: 4.2.1, frontend: 3.22.4)
- HIGH-003: 24 empty test file stubs (65% of test files)
- HIGH-004: Unbounded database queries in ReportController

**🟡 MEDIUM Priority:**
- MED-001: God Object - ReportTemplateService.ts (1,165 lines)
- MED-002: Production TODOs with mock data in controllers
- MED-003: Console logging instead of structured logging (7 files)
- MED-004: CSP unsafe-inline in production

**Recommendation:** Create Phase 5 work streams to address high-priority review findings.

## 📁 Recent Activity

### Git Commits (Last Hour)
```
No commits in the last 60 minutes
```

### Files Modified (Last 60 Minutes)
```
No file modifications detected
```

**Git Status:** Multiple staged files from previous hours (Phase 4 completion, documentation updates)

---

## 🔮 Next Hour Focus

**Expected Activity:** Continued monitoring and standby

### Monitoring Verification Needed
1. **Check monitoring script status**
   - Verify if PID 48515 is still running
   - Check log file: `dev-logs/24h-monitoring-20251227-181327.log`
   - Consider restarting monitoring if stopped

### Potential Next Actions
Since all 50 work streams are complete, next activities could include:

1. **Phase 5 Planning** - Address review findings
   - Security fixes (Puppeteer, Zod)
   - Test implementation (24 empty stubs)
   - Code quality improvements (God Object refactor)
   - Remove production TODOs

2. **Deployment Preparation**
   - GCP infrastructure already configured
   - Finalize deployment scripts
   - Production environment setup

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - API documentation
   - Deployment guides
   - User manuals
