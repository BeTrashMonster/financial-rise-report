## ⚠️ Issues & Concerns

### 🟠 HIGH Priority (Outstanding from Previous Review)
1. **Puppeteer Security Vulnerabilities:** HIGH severity in tar-fs dependency - requires upgrade to v24.34.0
2. **Zod Version Mismatch:** Backend specifies non-existent v4.2.1, frontend uses correct v3.22.4
3. **24 Empty Test Stubs:** 65% of test files contain only TODOs (24/37 files)
4. **Unbounded Database Query:** AssessmentResponse.findAll without limits in ReportController

### 🟡 MEDIUM Priority (Outstanding from Previous Review)
1. **ReportTemplateService God Object:** 1,165 lines (2.3x recommended limit)
2. **Production TODOs:** Controllers returning hardcoded DISC/phase mock data
3. **Console Logging:** 7 files using console.* instead of Winston logger
4. **CSP unsafe-inline:** Weakens XSS protection in production

### 📋 Current Hour Issues
- **No Development Activity:** Zero commits, zero file changes this hour
- **No Agent Activity:** Neither autonomous developer nor scheduled agents are running
- **Empty Hourly File:** dev-logs/hourly-update-20251227-1918.md was created but left empty

## 🔍 Notes & Observations

1. **Quiet Hour:** No development activity this hour - appears to be a monitoring/observation period between setup and execution phases.

2. **Empty Update File:** The file `hourly-update-20251227-1918.md` was created but left empty (0 bytes). This may indicate an interrupted update process or manual file creation.

3. **Monitoring Stability:** PID 48515 is recorded and monitoring continues to generate updates, indicating the 24-hour monitoring process is functioning.

4. **Phase Transition:** System appears to be in transition between Phase 1 completion (100%) and Phase 2 initiation. No active work streams are executing.

5. **Outstanding Review Issues:** The comprehensive architectural review from 17:40 identified 9 issues requiring attention, but no remediation work has begun yet.

6. **Team Launch Pending:** All planned team structures (Backend, Frontend, Integration/QA, Project Manager) remain in planning state with no agents deployed.
