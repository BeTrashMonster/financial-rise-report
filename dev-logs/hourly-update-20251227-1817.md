## ⚠️ Issues & Concerns

### 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Monitoring Process Not Running:** PID 48515 not found - 24h monitoring may have failed to start or terminated prematurely

### 🟠 HIGH Priority (from Review)
1. **Puppeteer Security Vulnerabilities:** HIGH severity in tar-fs dependency - needs upgrade to v24.34.0
2. **Zod Version Mismatch:** Backend specifies non-existent v4.2.1, frontend uses correct v3.22.4
3. **24 Empty Test Stubs:** 65% of test files contain only TODOs, creating false coverage
4. **Unbounded Database Query:** AssessmentResponse.findAll without limits in ReportController

### 🟡 MEDIUM Priority (from Review)
1. **ReportTemplateService God Object:** 1,165 lines (2.3x recommended limit)
2. **Production TODOs:** Controllers returning hardcoded DISC/phase data
3. **Console Logging:** 7 files using console.* instead of Winston
4. **CSP unsafe-inline:** Weakens XSS protection

2. **Address HIGH Priority Issues:** Begin fixing Zod version mismatch and Puppeteer vulnerabilities
3. **Establish Test Coverage Baseline:** Run tests to determine starting coverage percentage
4. **Verify Staging Environment:** Confirm infrastructure is operational

### Expected Activity
- No autonomous development scheduled yet (teams not launched)
- Monitoring system needs to be restarted
- Documentation review and infrastructure validation
- Planning for Phase 2 work stream execution

## 🔍 Notes & Observations

1. **Monitoring Process Issue:** The 24-hour monitoring process (PID 48515) that was reported as started in `monitoring-started-20251227-1813.md` is no longer running. This is the first hourly update, so this needs investigation.

2. **High-Quality Review Output:** The autonomous reviewer successfully completed a comprehensive scan in ~25 minutes, identifying actionable issues with specific file:line references.

3. **Documentation Phase:** The last hour focused on GCP infrastructure documentation rather than code implementation - aligns with Phase 1 being complete and Phase 2 planning underway.

4. **Test Coverage Gap:** 65% of test files are empty stubs - this is a significant blocker for Phase 2 work that requires TDD approach.

5. **No Active Development:** Neither autonomous developer nor team structures have begun work yet - monitoring is tracking the setup/planning phase.
