Perfect! I've generated the first hourly status update. Here's what I found:

## Summary

**Hourly Update Created:** `dev-logs/hourly-update-20251227-1817.md`

### Key Findings (Last Hour):

**Activity:**
- ✅ 1 comprehensive code review completed (9 issues found)
- ✅ GCP infrastructure documentation added (2,923 lines, 9 files)
- ❌ No autonomous development activity
- ⚠️ Monitoring process (PID 48515) not running

**Issues Identified:**
- 🔴 **CRITICAL:** Monitoring process terminated - needs restart
- 🟠 **4 HIGH:** Puppeteer vulnerabilities, Zod mismatch, 24 empty test stubs, unbounded queries
- 🟡 **4 MEDIUM:** God object, production TODOs, console logging, CSP issues

**Progress:**
- Phase 1: 100% complete (all 50 work streams)
- Phase 2: Planning phase, teams not yet launched
- No active work streams this hour

**Next Hour Actions:**
1. Restart 24-hour monitoring (process died)
2. Fix HIGH priority issues (Zod, Puppeteer)
3. Establish test coverage baseline
4. Launch team structures for Phase 2 work

The hourly update includes all metrics, file references, and detailed breakdowns as requested. The monitoring process appears to have terminated shortly after starting, which is flagged as a critical issue.
