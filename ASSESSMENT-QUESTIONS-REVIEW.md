## ⚠️ Questions for Review

**Before implementing results calculation, consider:**

1. **Are the scoring weights balanced?**
   - Is "Weekly" really worth 5 points vs "Monthly" at 4 points?
   - Should some questions be weighted more heavily?

2. **Are DISC questions well-disguised?**
   - Can clients guess these are personality questions?
   - Do they feel natural in a financial assessment?

3. **Is the conditional logic clear?**

## Scoring Logic Rules

### Rule 1: N/A Handling
```
If answer = N/A:
  - Award 0 points (numerator)
  - Exclude from max (denominator)
  - Calculate phase % based on applicable questions only
```

### Rule 2: Phase Percentage Calculation
```
Phase Score % = (Points Earned ÷ Applicable Max Points) × 100
```

### Rule 3: Multi-Select Cap (BUILD-007)
```
If selections ≥ 5: Score = 5
Else: Score = count of selections
```

### Rule 4: DISC Profile Calculation
```
For each trait (D, I, S, C):
  - Sum all points earned (exclude "None of these" responses)
  - Calculate percentage of 16
  - If >3 "None of these" selected, flag as "Blended/Situational Style"

Primary Style = Highest percentage (if >35%)
Secondary Style = Second highest (if within 15% of primary)
```

### Rule 5: DISC "None of These" Handling
```
If answer = "None of these fit me well":
  - Award full phase points (no penalty)
  - Award 0 DISC points (no trait assignment)
  - Track frequency for profile interpretation

If "None" selected on 4+ questions:
  - Display: "Your style appears situational — you adapt your approach based on context"
```

### Rule 6: Self-Assessment Validation (SYS-009 + SYS-010)
```
Compare SYS-009 rating to overall phase performance:
- If self-rating is 2+ points higher than actual → "Opportunity for deeper awareness"
- If self-rating matches actual (±1) → "Accurate self-perception"
- If self-rating is 2+ points lower than actual → "You're doing better than you think!"

Cross-reference with SYS-010:
- If SYS-010 = "surprised" AND scores are low → "Awareness is the first step"
- If SYS-010 = "surprised" AND scores are high → "You may be underestimating yourself"
```

### Rule 7: Conditional Logic (S-Corp)
```
If ORG-001 = "S-Corp":
  Display ORG-002 (S-Corp payroll question)
Else:
  Skip ORG-002
```
