### Common Client Questions

**Q: "Is it bad that I'm in the Stabilize phase?"**

A: "It varies by business, but typically 3-6 months of focused work. We'll track progress together and celebrate milestones along the way."

**Q: "Why do I need all these systems?"**
A: "Systems free up your time to focus on growth. Think of it as building a foundation that supports everything else you want to achieve."

**Q: "This seems overwhelming."**
A: "That's why we break it into small, manageable steps. We'll tackle one thing at a time, and I'll be here to support you throughout the process."
